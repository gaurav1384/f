## Step-by-Step Guide to Painting Gladiolus

Here's a step-by-step guide to painting gladiolus, suitable for beginners:

1.  **Sketching the Composition:** Start by lightly sketching the outline of the gladiolus on your painting surface. Pay attention to the overall shape, the angle of the stem, and the arrangement of the florets.
2.  **Blocking in the Background:** Apply a thin layer of background color, using a flat brush. Consider using soft, muted tones to create a sense of depth.
3.  **Establishing Values:** Identify the lightest and darkest areas of the gladiolus and begin to block in these values with your chosen paint.
4.  **Painting the Florets:** Start with the base color of each floret and gradually add highlights and shadows to create dimension. Use a round brush for detail work and a filbert brush for blending.
5.  **Adding Details:** Once the basic shapes and values are established, add details such as the veins on the petals, the texture of the stem, and any other unique characteristics.
6.  **Refining and Blending:** Take a step back and assess your painting. Make any necessary adjustments to the colors, values, and details. Use a soft brush to blend the edges of the florets and create a sense of harmony.
7.  **Final Touches:** Add any final details that will enhance your painting, such as highlights on the edges of the petals or shadows cast by the stem.
