Courses teach you how to create unique and exciting flavor combinations, using fresh ingredients, extracts, infusions, and more. You'll learn about flavor pairings, balancing sweetness and acidity, and developing your own signature creations.

*   **Learn about Business and Operations:** Turning your passion into a profitable business requires more than just great ice cream. Professional courses often include modules on business planning, marketing, cost analysis, and food safety regulations. You'll learn how to source ingredients, price your products, and build a successful brand.
