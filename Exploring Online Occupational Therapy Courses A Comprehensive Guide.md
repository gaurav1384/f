## The Rise of Online Occupational Therapy Education

The availability of online occupational therapy courses has revolutionized access to education in this field.  Traditional brick-and-mortar programs often require relocation, rigid schedules, and significant financial investment. Online courses offer a flexible and often more affordable alternative, making education accessible to a wider range of students, including those with family responsibilities, existing careers, or geographical limitations.

While a fully online degree program in occupational therapy (particularly at the Master's or Doctorate level, required for licensure) is rare due to the hands-on nature of clinical practice, many foundational courses, continuing education programs, and preparatory courses are readily available online.  These resources can be invaluable for aspiring occupational therapists, current practitioners seeking to expand their knowledge, and individuals interested in learning more about the principles of occupational therapy.
