## What is Music Therapy?

Music therapy is a clinical and evidence-based practice that involves using music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship.  Board-certified music therapists (MT-BCs) are trained to assess clients' needs, develop treatment plans, implement music-based interventions, and evaluate progress.  These interventions can include creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music.

Music therapy is not just about enjoying music; it's about harnessing its therapeutic potential to address a wide range of challenges, including:

*   **Mental health disorders:** Depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia
*   **Developmental disabilities:** Autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome
*   **Neurological conditions:** Stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease
*   **Physical rehabilitation:**  Recovering from injuries or surgeries
*   **Pain management:** Chronic pain, cancer pain
*   **End-of-life care:** Providing comfort and support
