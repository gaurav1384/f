## Nouns (संज्ञा – Sangya)

Nouns in Hindi, like in English, represent people, places, things, and ideas. However, a key difference lies in the concept of grammatical gender.

*   **Gender (लिंग – Ling):** Every noun in Hindi is either masculine (पुल्लिंग – Pulling) or feminine (स्त्रीलिंग – Striling). This gender assignment impacts agreement with verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. Unlike some languages where gender is purely grammatical, Hindi often has a semantic basis for gender assignment (e.g., "लड़का" (ladka – boy) is masculine, "लड़की" (ladki – girl) is feminine). However, many cases require memorization.

*   **Number (वचन – Vachan):** Hindi nouns can be singular (एकवचन – Ekavachan) or plural (बहुवचन – Bahuvachan). Plural formation often involves adding suffixes like "-ए" (-e) or "-ओं" (-on) to the singular form. The specific suffix used depends on the noun's gender and final sound.

*   **Case (कारक – Karak):** This is where Hindi grammar introduces its complexity. Case markers are postpositions (similar to prepositions in English, but placed *after* the noun) that indicate the noun's function in the sentence. Key cases include:

    *   **Nominative (कर्ता – Karta):** Indicates the subject of the verb. Often unmarked, but sometimes uses the postposition "ने" (ne) in the perfect tenses with transitive verbs.
    *   **Accusative/Objective (कर्म – Karma):** Indicates the direct object of the verb. Marked by the postposition "को" (ko).
    *   **Instrumental (करण – Karan):** Indicates the instrument or means by which an action is performed. Marked by "से" (se) or "के द्वारा" (ke dwara).
    *   **Dative (सम्प्रदान – Sampradan):** Indicates the indirect object of the verb; the recipient of something. Marked by "को" (ko) or "के लिए" (ke liye).  Note that "को" (ko) can mark both accusative and dative cases, context is key.
    *   **Ablative (अपादान – Apadan):** Indicates separation, origin, or comparison. Marked by "से" (se).
    *   **Genitive (संबंध – Sambandh):** Indicates possession or relationship. Marked by "का" (ka), "की" (ki), or "के" (ke), which agree in gender and number with the noun being possessed.
    *   **Locative (अधिकरण – Adhikaran):** Indicates location or time. Marked by "में" (mein – in, at) or "पर" (par – on, at).
    *   **Vocative (संबोधन – Sambodhan):** Used for direct address. Often marked by interjections like "हे" (he) or "अरे" (are).

Understanding case markers is crucial for constructing grammatically correct sentences.

## Pronouns (सर्वनाम – Sarvanaam)

Pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition. Hindi pronouns have different forms depending on politeness and formality.

*   **Personal Pronouns:**

    *   **मैं (Main):** I
    *   **तू (Tu):** You (informal, intimate)
    *   **तुम (Tum):** You (informal, respectful)
    *   **आप (Aap):** You (formal, very respectful)
    *   **वह (Vah):** He/She/It (near or less respectful)
    *   **ये (Ye):** These (near or less respectful)
    *   **यह (Yah):** This (near or less respectful)
    *   **वे (Ve):** They (near or less respectful)
    *   **हम (Hum):** We

Pronouns also inflect according to case, similar to nouns.

*   **Demonstrative Pronouns:** Indicate proximity or distance (e.g., "यह" (yah) – this, "वह" (vah) – that).

*   **Interrogative Pronouns:** Used for asking questions (e.g., "कौन" (kaun) – who, "क्या" (kya) – what).

*   **Relative Pronouns:** Connect clauses (e.g., "जो" (jo) – who, which, that).

*   **Indefinite Pronouns:** Refer to unspecified persons or things (e.g., "कोई" (koi) – someone, anyone).

## Verbs (क्रिया – Kriya)

Verbs express actions or states of being. Hindi verbs are highly inflected, changing according to tense, mood, aspect, gender, number, and person.

*   **Root Verb (धातु – Dhatu):** The basic form of the verb, often found in dictionaries.

*   **Tense (काल – Kaal):** Indicates the time of the action. The main tenses are:

    *   **Present Tense (वर्तमान काल – Vartmaan Kaal):** Describes actions happening now.
    *   **Past Tense (भूतकाल – Bhoot Kaal):** Describes actions that happened in the past.
    *   **Future Tense (भविष्यत काल – Bhavishyat Kaal):** Describes actions that will happen in the future.

    Within each tense, there are further subdivisions to indicate different aspects (e.g., simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous).

*   **Mood (वृत्ति – Vritti):** Indicates the speaker's attitude toward the action (e.g., indicative, imperative, subjunctive).

*   **Aspect (पक्ष – Paksh):**  Indicates the completeness or duration of the action.

*   **Agreement:** Verbs must agree in gender and number with the subject of the sentence.

*   **Auxiliary Verbs:** Verbs like "है" (hai – is), "था" (tha – was), and "होना" (hona – to be) are used to form compound tenses and other grammatical structures.

**Example:** The verb "जाना" (jana – to go)

*   **Root:** जा (ja)
*   **Present Tense (he):** वह जाता है (vah jata hai) - He goes.
*   **Past Tense (he):** वह गया था (vah gaya tha) - He went.
*   **Future Tense (he):** वह जाएगा (vah jayega) - He will go.

## Adjectives (विशेषण – Visheshan)

Adjectives describe nouns, providing more detail about their qualities.

*   **Types of Adjectives:**

    *   **Qualitative Adjectives:** Describe qualities like size, color, shape (e.g., "बड़ा" (bada) – big, "लाल" (lal) – red).
    *   **Quantitative Adjectives:** Indicate quantity or amount (e.g., "थोड़ा" (thoda) – a little, "बहुत" (bahut) – much, many).
    *   **Numerical Adjectives:** Indicate number or order (e.g., "एक" (ek) – one, "पहला" (pahla) – first).
    *   **Demonstrative Adjectives:** Point out specific nouns (e.g., "यह" (yah) – this, "वह" (vah) – that).

*   **Agreement:** Adjectives generally agree in gender and number with the noun they modify.

## Adverbs (क्रिया विशेषण – Kriya Visheshan)

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, providing more information about how, when, where, or to what extent something is done.

*   **Types of Adverbs:**

    *   **Adverbs of Manner:** Describe how an action is performed (e.g., "धीरे" (dheere) – slowly, "तेज़ी से" (tezi se) – quickly).
    *   **Adverbs of Time:** Indicate when an action takes place (e.g., "आज" (aaj) – today, "कल" (kal) – tomorrow/yesterday).
    *   **Adverbs of Place:** Indicate where an action takes place (e.g., "यहाँ" (yahan) – here, "वहाँ" (vahan) – there).
    *   **Adverbs of Degree:** Indicate the extent to which an action is performed (e.g., "बहुत" (bahut) – very, "कम" (kam) – less).
    *   **Adverbs of Frequency:** How often the action happen (e.g., "हमेशा" (Hamesha) - Always)

## Sentence Structure (वाक्य संरचना – Vakya Sanrachna)

The basic sentence structure in Hindi is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

*   **Subject (कर्ता – Karta):** The person or thing performing the action.
*   **Object (कर्म – Karma):** The person or thing receiving the action.
*   **Verb (क्रिया – Kriya):** The action being performed.

**Example:**

*   **English:** I eat an apple.
*   **Hindi:** मैं सेब खाता हूँ (Main seb khata hoon). (I apple eat am)

    *   मैं (Main) – I (Subject)
    *   सेब (Seb) – Apple (Object)
    *   खाता हूँ (Khata hoon) – Eat am (Verb)

While SOV is the typical structure, word order can sometimes be flexible, especially in spoken Hindi, without changing the meaning drastically. However, understanding the basic SOV structure is essential for building correct sentences.

## Additional Key Grammatical Concepts

*   **Postpositions:** As mentioned earlier, these function like prepositions but are placed *after* the noun or pronoun they govern. Examples include "को" (ko), "से" (se), "में" (mein), "पर" (par), "के लिए" (ke liye), "के साथ" (ke sath).

*   **Conjunctions (समुच्चयबोधक – Samuchchaybodhak):** Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., "और" (aur) – and, "लेकिन" (lekin) – but, "क्योंकि" (kyonki) – because).

*   **Interjections (विस्मयादिबोधक – Vismayadibodhak):** Words or phrases that express sudden emotion (e.g., "वाह!" (vah!) – Wow!, "अरे!" (are!) – Hey!).
