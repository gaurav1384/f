## What Makes a "Best" Online Portrait Drawing Course?

The "best" course is subjective, depending heavily on your current skill level, learning style, and specific goals. However, some common qualities consistently distinguish high-quality portrait drawing courses:

*   **Comprehensive Curriculum:** A great course will cover fundamental principles such as:

    *   **Proportion and Anatomy:** Understanding the underlying skeletal and muscular structure of the head is crucial for accurate and believable portraits. Look for courses that delve into skull anatomy, facial muscles, and how they affect surface forms.
    *   **Light and Shadow:** Mastering light and shadow is essential for creating depth and dimension in your drawings. The course should teach you how to identify light sources, render shadows, and create realistic highlights.
    *   **Facial Features:** Each feature (eyes, nose, mouth, ears) has its own unique structure and characteristics. A good course will provide detailed instructions on drawing each feature individually and in relation to each other.
    *   **Materials and Techniques:** The course should introduce you to a range of drawing materials (pencils, charcoal, erasers, paper) and techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, blending, stippling).
*   **Clear and Concise Instruction:** The instructor should be able to explain complex concepts in a clear, concise, and engaging manner. Look for courses with well-structured video lectures, demonstrations, and written materials.
*   **Practical Exercises and Assignments:** Theory is important, but practice is essential for mastering any art form. The best courses include plenty of practical exercises and assignments that allow you to apply what you've learned and receive feedback.
*   **Instructor Feedback and Support:** Access to instructor feedback is invaluable for identifying areas for improvement and staying motivated. Look for courses that offer opportunities to ask questions, submit your work for critique, and interact with other students.
*   **Focus on Individual Style:** While learning fundamental techniques is crucial, a good course will also encourage you to develop your own unique artistic style. The instructor should provide guidance on how to experiment with different materials, techniques, and approaches to portrait drawing.

## Exploring Different Learning Styles: Finding the Right Fit

Not all learning styles are created equal. Consider which approach best suits your needs:

*   **Beginner-Friendly Courses:** These courses are designed for individuals with little to no prior drawing experience. They typically start with the very basics, such as holding a pencil correctly and drawing basic shapes.
*   **Intermediate Courses:** These courses are suitable for students who have some drawing experience and are looking to improve their portrait drawing skills. They may cover more advanced topics, such as rendering complex lighting scenarios and capturing subtle expressions.
*   **Advanced Courses:** These courses are designed for experienced artists who are looking to master portrait drawing. They may cover topics such as drawing portraits from life, working with different mediums, and developing a unique artistic style.
*   **Specific Medium Courses:** Some courses focus on a specific medium, such as graphite pencils, charcoal, or colored pencils. These courses can be a great way to develop your skills in a particular area.
*   **Stylized Portrait Courses:** These courses focus on creating portraits in a specific style, such as cartooning, manga, or photorealism. If you are interested in a particular style, a stylized portrait course may be a good choice.

## Key Techniques Covered in the Best Courses

Regardless of the level, a high-quality portrait drawing course should cover these key techniques:

1.  **Construction and Proportion:** Building a solid foundation for your portrait begins with understanding the proportions of the human head. Learn to accurately map out the placement of features using guidelines and landmarks.
2.  **Value and Shading:** Master the art of creating tonal values to give your drawings depth and dimension. Learn different shading techniques like hatching, cross-hatching, blending, and stippling to create realistic shadows and highlights.
3.  **Understanding Anatomy:** Gain a working knowledge of facial anatomy to understand how muscles and bone structure influence the surface forms you see.
4.  **Capturing Likeness:** Develop your observational skills to accurately capture the unique features and characteristics of your subject.
5.  **Rendering Texture and Details:** Learn how to depict different textures like skin, hair, and clothing to add realism and interest to your portraits.

## Choosing the Right Materials for Your Portrait Drawing Journey

While a great course provides the knowledge, having the right tools enhances your learning experience. Here's a basic list:

*   **Pencils:** A range of graphite pencils (e.g., 2H, HB, 2B, 4B, 6B) will allow you to create a full range of values.
*   **Erasers:** A kneaded eraser and a white plastic eraser are essential for correcting mistakes and creating highlights.
*   **Paper:** Choose a smooth or slightly textured drawing paper that is appropriate for your chosen medium.
*   **Blending Stumps or Tortillions:** These tools can be used to blend graphite and charcoal to create smooth transitions.
*   **Sharpener:** A good quality pencil sharpener is essential for keeping your pencils sharp.
