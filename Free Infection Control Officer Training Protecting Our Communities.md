*   **Preventing Outbreaks:** ICOs are essential in identifying and controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases. They investigate potential outbreaks, implement control measures, and educate staff and the public about prevention.
*   **Ensuring Compliance:** Healthcare facilities are subject to regulations and guidelines related to infection control. ICOs ensure that their facilities comply with these requirements, minimizing the risk of penalties and legal liabilities.
*   **Promoting Public Health:** Infection control extends beyond healthcare facilities. ICOs can also work in public health settings, developing and implementing strategies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the community.
