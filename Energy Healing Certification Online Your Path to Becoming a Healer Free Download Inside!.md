## What is Energy Healing?

Energy healing is a broad term encompassing various techniques that aim to manipulate, balance, and restore the flow of energy within the body and its energetic field. These techniques are based on the understanding that a vital life force, often referred to as "qi," "prana," or "energy," flows through and around all living beings. Disruptions or blockages in this energy flow are believed to contribute to physical, emotional, and mental health issues.

Some of the most common types of energy healing include:

*   **Reiki:** A Japanese technique that involves channeling universal life force energy through the practitioner's hands to the recipient.
*   **Pranic Healing:** A no-touch technique that uses prana (life force) to cleanse, energize, and balance the energy body.
*   **Quantum Touch:** A technique that uses light touch and focused breathing to amplify the body's natural healing abilities.
*   **Healing Touch:** A biofield therapy that uses gentle touch to balance and align the human energy field.
*   **Chakra Balancing:** Techniques aimed at balancing and clearing the seven major energy centers (chakras) in the body.
*   **Sound Healing:** Using sound vibrations from instruments like singing bowls, tuning forks, and gongs to promote relaxation and healing.
