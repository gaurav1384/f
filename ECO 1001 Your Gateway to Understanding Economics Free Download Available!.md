## What is ECO 1001?

ECO 1001 is generally the introductory course to economics, often offered at the undergraduate level. It aims to provide a broad overview of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, laying the groundwork for more advanced study. Think of it as the "Economics 101" of your academic journey.

Here’s a breakdown of the typical topics covered:

**1. Introduction to Economics:**

*   **What is Economics?** Defining economics as the study of scarcity, choice, and resource allocation. Understanding the difference between positive and normative economics.
*   **The Economic Problem:** Scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity cost (the value of the next best alternative forgone), and the production possibilities frontier (PPF). The PPF demonstrates the limits of production given limited resources and technology.
*   **Economic Systems:** Examining different types of economic systems, such as market economies, command economies, and mixed economies. Understanding the role of government in each system.
*   **Basic Economic Concepts:** Introducing fundamental concepts like supply, demand, equilibrium, elasticity, and market structures.

**2. Microeconomics:**

Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual economic agents, such as households, firms, and markets. Key topics typically include:

*   **Supply and Demand:** The law of demand (as price increases, quantity demanded decreases) and the law of supply (as price increases, quantity supplied increases). Market equilibrium, where supply and demand intersect, determining the price and quantity of a good or service.
*   **Elasticity:** Measuring the responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price, income, or other factors. Understanding price elasticity of demand (PED), income elasticity of demand (YED), and cross-price elasticity of demand (XED).
*   **Market Structures:** Analyzing different types of market structures, including perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. Understanding the characteristics and implications of each structure for pricing, output, and efficiency.
*   **Consumer Behavior:** Exploring consumer preferences, utility maximization (making choices to get the most satisfaction), and budget constraints. Indifference curves and budget lines are used to illustrate consumer choice.
*   **Production and Costs:** Understanding production functions (how inputs are transformed into outputs) and cost curves (fixed costs, variable costs, marginal cost, average cost). Analyzing the relationship between production and costs.
*   **Market Failures:** Identifying situations where markets fail to allocate resources efficiently, such as externalities (costs or benefits that affect third parties), public goods (non-excludable and non-rivalrous goods), and information asymmetry (unequal information between buyers and sellers). The role of government intervention to correct market failures.

**3. Macroeconomics:**

Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, focusing on aggregate variables such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Key topics usually include:

*   **Measuring Economic Activity:** Understanding GDP (Gross Domestic Product), the total value of goods and services produced in a country, and related measures such as GNP (Gross National Product) and national income. The expenditure approach, income approach, and production approach to calculating GDP. Real GDP vs. nominal GDP.
*   **Economic Growth:** Analyzing the factors that contribute to long-run economic growth, such as capital accumulation, technological progress, and human capital development. Growth models like the Solow model.
*   **Unemployment:** Defining and measuring unemployment. Different types of unemployment (frictional, structural, cyclical). The natural rate of unemployment.
*   **Inflation:** Understanding inflation, the general increase in prices, and deflation, the general decrease in prices. Measuring inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP deflator. Causes of inflation (demand-pull and cost-push inflation).
*   **The Business Cycle:** Analyzing the fluctuations in economic activity, including recessions (periods of economic contraction) and expansions (periods of economic growth). Leading, lagging, and coincident economic indicators.
*   **Fiscal Policy:** Understanding the role of government spending and taxation in influencing the economy. The effects of government deficits and debt. Fiscal policy tools (e.g., tax cuts, increased government spending) to stimulate or restrain the economy.
*   **Monetary Policy:** Understanding the role of central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve in the US) in controlling the money supply and interest rates. Monetary policy tools (e.g., open market operations, reserve requirements, discount rate) to influence inflation and unemployment.
*   **International Trade:** Analyzing the benefits of international trade, including specialization and comparative advantage. Trade barriers (tariffs, quotas). Exchange rates and the balance of payments.
