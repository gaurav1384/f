## What is EPA Section 608 Certification?

The EPA Section 608 certification is mandated by the Clean Air Act to prevent the release of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere. This regulation aims to protect the ozone layer, which shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Certified technicians demonstrate their understanding of proper refrigerant handling practices, including recovery, recycling, and reclamation.

## Types of EPA Section 608 Certification

There are four main types of EPA Section 608 certification, each corresponding to specific types of equipment:

*   **Type I: Small Appliances:** This certification covers technicians who service, maintain, or dispose of small appliances containing five pounds or less of refrigerant. Examples include refrigerators, freezers, window air conditioners, and dehumidifiers.

*   **Type II: High-Pressure Appliances:** This certification applies to technicians working on high-pressure appliances, such as residential air conditioning systems, heat pumps, and supermarket refrigeration units.

*   **Type III: Low-Pressure Appliances:** This certification is for technicians servicing, maintaining, or disposing of low-pressure appliances like chillers.

*   **Universal Certification:** This certification encompasses all three types (Type I, Type II, and Type III). Technicians with Universal certification are qualified to work on any type of equipment covered by Section 608 regulations.

## The EPA Universal Certification Exam

The EPA Universal Technician Certification exam consists of four sections:

1.  **Core:** This section covers general knowledge about the Clean Air Act, ozone depletion, refrigerant recovery, recycling, reclamation, and related environmental concerns.
