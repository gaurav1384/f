## What is Guided Biofilm Therapy (GBT)?

GBT is a systematic, predictable approach to dental biofilm management. It's based on established scientific evidence and emphasizes patient comfort and minimal invasiveness. Unlike traditional methods that can be abrasive and sometimes painful, GBT utilizes specialized techniques and equipment to gently and effectively remove biofilm, the sticky, bacteria-laden film that accumulates on teeth and gums.

The GBT protocol typically involves eight key steps:

1.  **Assess:** The dentist or hygienist thoroughly assesses the patient's oral health, including their medical history and any specific concerns.

2.  **Disclose:** Biofilm is made visible using a disclosing agent. This helps both the practitioner and the patient understand where biofilm is accumulating.

3.  **Motivate:** The patient is educated about the importance of biofilm control and how GBT works. This is a crucial step in empowering patients to take ownership of their oral health.

4.  **Airflow:** A specialized device called an AIRFLOW® Prophylaxis Master uses air, water, and erythritol powder to gently remove biofilm and stains from supragingival (above the gum line) and subgingival (below the gum line) areas. Erythritol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that is less abrasive than traditional polishing pastes.

5.  **Perioflow:** For deeper periodontal pockets and implants, a PERIOFLOW® nozzle is used with the AIRFLOW® device to gently remove biofilm.

6.  **Piezon:** The PIEZON® NO PAIN technology uses ultrasonic vibrations to remove remaining calculus and hard deposits with minimal discomfort.

7.  **Check:** A final check is performed to ensure all biofilm and calculus have been removed.

8.  **Recall:** A personalized recall schedule is established to maintain optimal oral health.

## Benefits of GBT

*   **Gentle and Comfortable:** GBT is significantly less abrasive than traditional scaling and polishing, making it a more comfortable experience for patients.
*   **Effective Biofilm Removal:** The disclosing agent and specialized equipment ensure that all biofilm is thoroughly removed, even in hard-to-reach areas.
*   **Improved Gum Health:** By effectively removing biofilm, GBT helps prevent and manage gingivitis and periodontitis.
*   **Reduced Sensitivity:** The gentle nature of GBT can reduce tooth sensitivity, especially after treatment.
